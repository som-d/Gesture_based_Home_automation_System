# Gesture_based_Home_automation_System

You can use your Hand gesture to control Home appliances.

Installation procedure:

1) First install Python 2.7. Leave all settings as default. In that case, Python will be installed in default folder
C:\Python27\

2) Download PyCharm ide for running python programs. It is not a compulsory step, but it is one of the
most easy way to work with python. This is because you can download modules directly from
PyCharm>settings>Project >Project Interpreter>’plus sign’>install required module or package.

2) Now install NumPy module. Again leave everything default. NumPy will find Python directory and will
be installed to most appropriate folder. Or else you can directly download it inside PyCharm.

3) Now double-click OpenCV.exe. It will ask for extraction folder. Give it as just C:\. It will extract all files
to C:\opencv\ . Wait until everything is extracted.

4) Now copy everything in the folder C:\opencv\build\python\x86\2.7\ ( most probably, there will be only
one file cv2.pyd ) and paste it in the folder C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\

5) Now open your "Python IDLE" ( from Start > All Programmes > Python 2.7 > Python IDLE ) and just
type following : import cv2

If everything OK, it will import cv2 module, otherwise an error message will be shown.
